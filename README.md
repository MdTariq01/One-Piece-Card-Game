## About The Project

This project was born from a passion for both the One Piece series and trading card games. The goal is to build a feature-complete digital client that allows players to build decks, challenge friends, and test their skills in a simulated environment that mirrors the official TCG rules as closely as possible.

We are focusing on creating a stable, intuitive, and visually appealing platform for all One Piece fans.
